						<p><a href="#"><img width="180" height="120" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/Bithguri.jpg"></a>According to Kollokotron himself, his grandfather, Jani Bocka consisted of a large stature and had a fairly bonny rear-end. At one time, an Albanian that had been looking at him, remarked: what is this bithgur(lit. stone-posterior)? Since then, indicated Kollokotron, his grandfather was stuck with the nickname "Bithgur", which eventually replaced the family name Bocka. In fact, the meaning of Kollokotron as a word is a direct translation into Greek of Arvanite name "Bithgur", that is hard posterior.

<p>As it could be imagined, the people called the Elder Bithguri, while today's voluble historians refer to him with the translated name, "Kollokotron", which raises the question: as long as the people devotes its songs to its heroes (in verse and music) in its own language and not in the language of volubels, what has happened to the folk songs about Bithguri? We know songs about Bithguri, but evidently these are songs that have transformed by the volubles and which we today call folk songs, while the original folk songs have been buried by time. And unfortunately, this in not an isolated case.</p>
